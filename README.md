# PSoC 6&trade; MCU: Dual-CPU IPC semaphore

This example demonstrates how to use the inter-processor communication (IPC) driver to implement a semaphore in PSoC&trade; 6 MCU. The semaphore is used as a lock to control access to a resource shared by the CPUs and synchronize the initialization instructions.

See the "PSoC&trade; 6 MCU dual-CPU development" section in [AN215656](https://www.cypress.com/AN215656) – *PSoC&trade; 6 MCU Dual-CPU system design* for instructions on how to develop dual-CPU applications.


## Overview

In this example, both CPUs in PSoC&trade; 6 MCU share the UART hardware block to send messages to the computer. An IPC semaphore controls the access to the UART to avoid situations where both CPUs attempt to send messages at the same time. The same IPC semaphore is also used to synchronize the initialization code between the two CPUs. The example provides an option to disable semaphore usage to observe how it affects the system. An LED on the kit indicates whether the semaphore is being used.

## Hardware setup

This example uses the board's default configuration. See the kit user guide to ensure that the board is configured correctly.

**Note:** The PSoC&trade; 6 Bluetooth&reg; LE pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC&trade; 6 Wi-Fi Bluetooth&reg; pioneer kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox&trade; software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".


## Software setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

This example requires no additional software or tools.


## Using the code example

Create the project and open it using one of the following:

<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

1. Click the **New Application** link in the **Quick Panel** (or, use **File** > **New** > **ModusToolbox Application**). This launches the [Project Creator](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool.

2. Pick a kit supported by the code example from the list shown in the **Project Creator - Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** dialog.

   When you select a supported kit, the example is reconfigured automatically to work with the kit. To work with a different supported kit later, use the [Library Manager](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxLibraryManager) to choose the BSP for the supported kit. You can use the Library Manager to select or update the BSP and firmware libraries used in this application. To access the Library Manager, click the link from the **Quick Panel**.

   You can also just start the application creation process again and select a different kit.

   If you want to use the application for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. In the **Project Creator - Select Application** dialog, choose the example by enabling the checkbox.

4. Optionally, change the suggested **New Application Name**.

5. The **Application(s) Root Path** defaults to the Eclipse workspace which is usually the desired location for the application. If you want to store the application in a different location, you can change the *Application(s) Root Path* value. Applications that share libraries should be in the same root path.

6. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

For more details, see the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/ide_{version}/docs/mt_ide_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In command-line interface (CLI)</b></summary>

ModusToolbox&trade; software provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool, "project-creator-cli". The CLI tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the "project-creator-cli" tool. On Windows, use the command line "modus-shell" program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; software installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; software tools. You can access it by typing `modus-shell` in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following table lists the arguments for this tool:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [BSP](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the `<id>` field of the [CE](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional


The following example will clone the "[Hello World](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/mtb-example-psoc6-hello-world)" application with the desired name "MyHelloWorld" configured for the *CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT --app-id mtb-example-psoc6-hello-world --user-app-name MyHelloWorld --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

**Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For more details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

</details>

<details><summary><b>In third-party IDEs</b></summary>

Use one of the following options:

- **Use the standalone [Project Creator](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) tool:**

   1. Launch Project Creator from the Windows Start menu or from *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/project-creator.exe*.

   2. In the initial **Choose Board Support Package** screen, select the BSP and click **Next**.

   3. In the **Select Application** screen, select the appropriate IDE from the **Target IDE** drop-down menu.

   4. Click **Create** and follow the instructions printed in the bottom pane to import or open the exported project in the respective IDE.

- **Use command-line interface (CLI):**

   1. Follow the instructions from the **In command-line interface (CLI)** section to create the application, and import the libraries using the `make getlibs` command.

   2. Export the application to a supported IDE using the `make <ide>` command.

   3. Follow the instructions displayed in the terminal to create or import the application as an IDE project.

For a list of supported IDEs and more details, see the "Exporting to IDEs" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; software install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf*).

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>

   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain and target are specified in the application's Makefile but you can override those values manually:
      ```
      make program TARGET=<BSP> TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TARGET=CY8CPROTO-062-4343W TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that "IPC Semaphore Example" and other text is displayed on the UART terminal.

5. Press the user button on the kit. The terminal prints messages from both cores without any conflicts. Messages are printed every time you press the button.

   **Figure 1. Terminal prints using semaphore**

   ![](images/terminal-with-sema.png)

6. Set the `#define ENABLE_SEMA` to *0u* in the *shared/include/ipc_def.h* file at line 41. Recompile the project and program it into the PSoC&trade; 6 MCU device. The red LED in the board should turn on, indicating that the semaphore is not used in the application.

7. Press the user button on the kit. The terminal will print messages from both CPUs, but with conflicts.

   **Figure 2. Terminal prints without semaphore**

   ![](images/terminal-without-sema.png)


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.


## Design and implementation

In this code example, the CM4 CPU is the primary CPU, which is responsible for initializing the system. To avoid any access to uninitialized hardware, the CM0+ CPU waits for CM4 to complete the system initialization by using a semaphore. Before CM4 executes code, CM0+ locks a semaphore, releases CM4 to execute, and then goes to sleep until CM4 unlocks the semaphore.

The same semaphore is also used as a method to synchronize the access to a shared resource by the two CPUs. In this case, a UART block is the resource. Both CPUs print a message to the computer terminal through UART everytime the user button is pressed. Before printing a message, both CPUs attempt to lock the semaphore. If it succeeds, it prints the message, and then unlocks the semaphore afterwards. If the semaphore is already locked, it keeps trying to lock it until it succeeds.

The firmware has an option to disable the semaphore in the code. By simply changing `#define ENABLE_SEMA` to *0u* in the *ipc_def.h* file, the semaphore is no longer locked by the CPUs; in addition, the kit LED turns on. Without the semaphore to synchronize access to the UART block, messages from both CPUs might overlap.

### Folder Structure

This application has a different folder structure because it contains the firmware for CM4 and CM0+ applications as follows:
```
    |-- cm0p_app/           # CM0+ application folder
        |-- main.c
        |-- Makefile
        |-- deps/           # All dependencies for CM0+
    |-- cm4_app/            # CM4 application folder
        |-- main.c
        |-- Makefile
        |-- deps/           # All dependencies for CM4
    |-- shared/             # Shared folder for CM0+ and CM4
        |-- include/        # Shared header files
```
